Hi, I'm Simon. I work as a Web Performance Consultant with [NCC Group Web Performance](https://www.nccgroup.com/en/our-services/website-performance/) in Surrey, UK.
I have a passion for all things fast and work with some of the UK's largest websites to help improve their users' online experiences.

I talk about front-end performance with anyone that will listen. Have a look at [some of my talks](/talks) to see what I say.

I live in Surrey, UK with my wife [Rachel](http://rachel.hearne.me/) and our son Reuben.
