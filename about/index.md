<p>Hi, I'm Simon. I work as a Web Performance Consultant with <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/en/our-services/website-performance/" target="_blank">NCC Group Web Performance</a> in Surrey, UK.
I have a passion for all things fast and work with some of the UK's largest websites to help improve their users' online experiences.</p><p>
I talk about front-end performance with anyone that will listen. Have a look at <a href="/talks">some of my talks</a> to see what I say.

You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/simonhearne" target="_blank">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonhearne" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
I live in Surrey, UK with my wife <a href="http://rachel.hearne.me/" target="_blank">Rachel</a> and our son Reuben.
