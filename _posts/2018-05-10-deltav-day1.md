## Tim Kadlec - Redefining Web Performance
There is a lot of under-appreciated creativity in technical work.
Definitions change - dictionaries are out of date as soon as they are printed - like JS frameworks.

<b>Network Constraint</b> - 71% of global connections are 2G or 3G, we live with a rose-tinted view of the world.

<b>Device Constraint</b> - new adoption is on low-end Android devices. 90th percentile JS payload is 1MB (compressed) / 7MB (uncompressed).

Performance cannot be fixed top-down (AMP / FIA / Apple News).
It took the New York Times 10 years to fix their performance problem.

<b>Speculative execution</b> - a performance optimisation without considerations for the implications. (Spectre / Meltdown).

<b>Access & accessibility</b> - he keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems.
Performance is about the level of effort, human memory limits, task completion.

> Web Performance: how quickly users can complete their task.

## Sarah Dapul-Weberman - The first 10 months of a dedicated web performance team at Pinterest

<b>Discovering the value of performance</b>
Migration of user pages to React -> 20% performance gain. Led to 10 - 20% engagement increase.
Non-auth pages 30% faster -> 15% more signups, 10% increase in SEO traffic.

<b>No ownership of performance</b> -> started dedicated performance teams for web, Android and iOS.

<b>Pinner Wait Time (PWT)</b> as the key performance metric - a composite of the time to render the key image and the comments / metadata.

Get rid of vanity metrics - prove correlation with business goals or drop them.
Performance is a <em>lever</em> to change the business metrics.

<b>Impact Assessments</b> - artificially delay key metrics and measure the impact on user behaviour / business metrics.

<b>PR campaign</b> to publicise the performance team on all-hands calls.
Each critical page is tested multiple hundreds of times on every commit - the 90th percentile of PWT is taken and plotted, threshold-based alerts.

<b>"Perf Detective"</b> performs a binary search with performance testing (like git bisect) to find the exact commit which caused the regression.

<b>Changes are prototyped first</b> to provide estimated performance wins - before development starts! Once the projects are decided on they are tested in an A/B framework which has performance and engagement metrics built in!
A/B test results are segmented by geography, user behaviour profiles etc.

The team beat the original goal of 14% improvement by an additional 20%!
Vision: five pillars:
 1. Scalability (team) - we canâ€™t be the only people working on performance. Enable product teams to manage performance.
 2. Ownership - each team owns their surface performance. Decentralised monitoring.
 3. Knowledge base - create a central place to document what performance looks like at Pinterest
 4. Tooling - create / purchase the tools which developers want to use
 5. Strategy - performance team will own the performance strategy - where to focus, tool management. Distribute the work.

## Rhys Evans - Speeding up FT.com, without slowing down

[Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/player/845b3dbdbfab441b86a059966bb68d69) | [@wheresrhys](https://twitter.com/wheresrhys)

The old FT.com site (Falcon) was slow and high-risk. One release a month!

> If we ever need to start from scratch again, we've gone badly wrong

For the new site, the team insisted on control of all web content, including third-parties.

Deploy local -> production in 10 minutes using CircleCI and Heroku. Feature flags enable roll-out of features to live traffic.

~100 microservices create the FT.com back-end stack.
Componentisation at the front-end using [Origami](http://origami.ft.com).

> These practices free us to release quality software quickly, with confidence

Microservices add extra latency to user requests due to dependency chains. Ft.com uses multiple caching layers to resolve that.

Preflight enables intelligent caching at the edge. But this itself is another performance bottleneck with multiple microservices! <b>Every service</b> is measured, medians and percentiles are used and the number of timeouts are counted and plotted too.

<b>Code impatiently</b> - HTTP agent keep alive to create connection pools. Pessimistic timeouts - fail fast and provide error details.

Fast releases reduced asset reuse - with no inlined CSS or shared JS bundles! 

The singular focus on performance made releases harder, alienated the development team.

> Performance is not a core front-end skill. It's weird, complex and <b>optional</b>

Performance optimisations should be discussed with the whole team, especially junior developers. Optimisations should be released early and often, tested and balanced with developer convenience.

> You don't have to be perfect to get results!
