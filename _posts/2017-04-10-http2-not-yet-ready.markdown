## The promise of HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is the saviour of the modern web. The most recent previous version of the HTTP protocol, HTTP/1.1, is not suited to delivering modern web applications. Have you ever created an image sprite, bundled JavaScript assets or sharded domains? All of these web performance techniques are workarounds for the deficiencies in the protocol.

HTTP/2 is designed to be much more efficient over the network, from compressing headers (using a smart dictionary system) to multiplexing requests over a single TCP connection.
