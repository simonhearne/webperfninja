## Alice Goldfuss - The Container Operator’s Manual

Containers are generally presented in theory, Alice tells us how they work in real-life. Alice is an SRE at GitHub and has run Docker in production for 3.5 years, so knows a bit about containers in the wild!

1) Containers have strengths.

 - Stateless applications / processes

2) Containers have weaknesses.

 - Stateful applications / databases
Don't containerise databases - use cloud services

3) Containers need friends.

 - Multiple tools, vendors and products required to manage, deploy, network, monitor etc.

4) Containers need headcount

 - You need a whole team of engineers (6-8 people ideally) to build a container platform:
  - operations
  - deployments
  - tooling
  - monitoring
  - kernel
  - network
  - infosec
  - internal adoption
  - project manager

> Do you want containers, or a blog post?!

## First Steps as a Lead - Dan Persa (⚡️ talk)

@danpersa

Dan is an engineering lead at Zalando, based in Berlin.

> Dealing with people problems is much more interesting than dealing with development problems

The responsibility of tech leads varies by company, from a technical lead role to a line management role. It is important to understand the role at your company and whether it fits your career goals.

Dan had three months of intense mentoring from an experienced tech lead at Zalando as part of a transition process from engineer to lead.

Dan's tips on how to learn fast:
 
 1) get a mentor
 2) _apply_ what you read in books
 3) reflect on your past - how you were managed

Trust instead of control:

 1) earn the respect of the team through pair-programming
 2) regular 1:1s
 3) transparency around performance evaluations

The lead's role is to help the team discover solutions to challenges, not to solve them yourself.

Not taking a decision is a decision in itself.

Give feedback as soon as possible, with a balance of positive and constructive feedback. Always ask for feedback in return.
