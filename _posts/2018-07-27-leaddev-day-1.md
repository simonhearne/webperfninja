## Alice Goldfuss - The Container Operatorâ€™s Manual

Containers are generally presented in theory, Alice tells us how they work in real-life. Alice is an SRE at GitHub and has run Docker in production for 3.5 years, so knows a bit about containers in the wild!

1) Containers have strengths.

 - Stateless applications / processes

2) Containers have weaknesses.

 - Stateful applications / databases
Don't containerise databases - use cloud services

3) Containers need friends.

 - Multiple tools, vendors and products required to manage, deploy, network, monitor etc.

4) Containers need headcount

 - You need a whole team of engineers (6-8 people ideally) to build a container platform:
  - operations
  - deployments
  - tooling
  - monitoring
  - kernel
  - network
  - infosec
  - internal adoption
  - project manager
