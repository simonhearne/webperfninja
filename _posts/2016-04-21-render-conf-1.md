I'm attending Render - previously known as jQuery UK. It's a front-end conference for front-end people, which makes me a bit of an outsider. Performance is not the focus of Render.

I rarely get to speak to front-end devs. I invariably sit with managers, not the people who actually do the work. Render is an opportunity for me to hone up my front-end skills and get an idea for what front-end devs are up against.

This post is a summary of the talks from day 1 of Render conference.

###Bruce Lawson - web.next.

####[Description](http://2016.render-conf.com/talks#webnext) | My Rating: ★★★★★ 

I had assumed that Bruce's talk would be identical to the [last few I've seen](http://localhost:4000/2015/velocity-europe-2015-report-1/#ensuring-a-high-performing-web-for-the-next-billion-people---bruce-lawson-opera-asa). I was wrong.

This time, Bruce opened with a personal story of his diagnosis with Multiple Sclerosis while working at a primary school in the far east.

Bruce's previous talks on web.next have focused on where customers are coming from and what devices they are using. This talk was much more focused around the web technologies that will *allow* the next 4 billion people to use the web.

Progressive Web Apps [will replace native mobile apps](http://loxima.com/blog/the-death-of-apps/) and this is a good thing: a relatively light-weight 20MB app might take over 30 minutes to install on 2G - by which time the network will probably have flaked out, Bruce notes.

PWAs increase accessibility to those mobile users with limited devices and limited connectivity.

In telling his story, Bruce highlighted how browser manufacturers have had to collaborate to create better web technologies - and thus better user experiences. Mozilla, Google, Opera and Microsoft are trying to improve their relationship with web developers to produce scalable and useful functionality. AppCache is the counter-example Bruce uses to demonstrate what happens when this relationship is not built correctly.

Another great talk by Bruce, inspiring a room of front-end engineers to get involved with the Web Platform Incubator Group ([https://www.w3.org/blog/2015/07/wicg/](WICG)).
