## Tammy Everts - Hunting the Unicorn

Tammy started researching user experience on the web in a laboratory setting - measuring individuals as they used websites. Now she works with SpeedCurve trying to connect the dots between real people and the stream of data being collected from Real User Monitoring.

> How do we scale empathy?

As we collect millions or billions of user experience data points, how do we remind ourselves that there are real people on the other end of the data?

The average web user believes that they waste <b>two days a year</b> waiting for web pages to load.

We know that slow sites suck, but how do we define <em>slow</em> and how do we define <em>suck</em>? We are perception brokers. But perceptions are fluid and, well, perceptual. How can we measure something so dynamic?

Our traditional web performance metrics like start render, page load, speed index do not help us to measure perception!

The best UX metric needs to correlate to what users actually see, it needs to be easy to use and work out-of-the box in browsers, it should recognise that not all pixels and page elements are equal and should be customisable based on our knowledge of our sites.

<b>First meaningful paint (FMP)</b> - times the paint after which the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened or when web fonts are loaded, whichever comes later. Available in Chrome.

<b>Time to first interactive (TTFI)</b> - when the page is first expected to be usable and will respond quickly to user interactions. Available in WebPageTest and mPulse.

<b>Hero rendering times</b> - the time at which the largest image, largest background image and top-level heading render.

To help work out the best metrics, SpeedCurve created a [test page](http://lab.speedcurve.com/rendering/picker.php) where you can see what metric correlates best with your perception of page load. The results unsurprisingly show that there is no metric that works for all sites, nor one that works for all people.

<b>Custom metrics</b> are the only way to measure what you know is important to your page, for your users. E.g. time-to-first-scroll, time to product image. Unfortunately these aren't necessary accessible or easy to use.

Whatever you measure:
1. Know your most meaningful metrics
2. Track them with synthetic and RUM
3. Don't focus on averages and medians
4. Set goals / budgets
5. Make yourself accountable with alerts and reports
6. Mind regressions

## Jeremy Keith - What is a progressive web app?

There is a lot of confusion and misinformation about what progressive web apps (PWAs) are. They do not require a single-page application JavaScript framework!

Most of what makes a PWA is just what makes a got website - secure, fast and responsive. You can measure that a site has https, service worker and a web app manifest - that's what makes a <em>measurable</em> PWA.

> Add to home screen is a bit of a distraction for PWAs, don't worry too much about it

Service Workers are the key part of a PWA, and they enable varying levels of offline functionality:
1. An "offline" error page - e.g.
2. A full offline experience - e.g.
3. A user-initiated page download - e.g. [Una Kravet's](https://una.im) website

> Should your site be progressive web app? Yes, it should

Jeremy has [published a book](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline) about using Service Workers to create great offline experiences.

## Mark Leach and Andy Davies - Fast Fashion

Mark works at Missguided.com - a fast fashion brand aimed at trend-conscious women aged 18 - 29.

> Our job is to empower young women to feel strong and confident

Mark's customers are all on social media, and are keen to complain when the website is slow.

When working with NCC Group Web Performance (now Eggplant) Mark was told that there could be an additional Â£1.2M through performance improvements.

When analysing the website, it was discovered that the median Android page load time was <b>over 14 (fourteen) seconds</b>.

Adding <pre><link rel="preload"></pre> for web fonts and fixing some issues with Optimizely brought the Android page load time down by two seconds.

Removing BazaarVoice improved load time by a further <b>3 (three) seconds</b> for Android devices. This improvement led to an increase in weekly revenue of <b>56%</b> ðŸ˜®. When baselined against all other traffic with BazaarVoice still enabled, the net gain in revenue was <b>26%</b>.

When presenting to the board, initially they were pessimistic about the potential, but then saw the real data. Then they wanted more!

In October 2017, Missguided set a goal of a three second load time. Andy used [source map explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer) to visualise the JavaScript and CSS bundles. The JavaScript bundle was reduced by 42%!

Missguided then hired someone to manage A/B testing and experiments to improve speed, as Optimizely could not be removed. This involved removing the bundled jQuery from the Optimizely bundle, removing old experiments and those for non-production environments.

Overall, median performance on Android was improved from 14 seconds to just over 5 seconds.
