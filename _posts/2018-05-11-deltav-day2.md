## Tammy Everts - Hunting the Unicorn

Tammy started researching user experience on the web in a laboratory setting - measuring individuals as they used websites. Now she works with SpeedCurve trying to connect the dots between real people and the stream of data being collected from Real User Monitoring.

> How do we scale empathy?

As we collect millions or billions of user experience data points, how do we remind ourselves that there are real people on the other end of the data?

The average web user believes that they waste <b>two days a year</b> waiting for web pages to load.

We know that slow sites suck, but how do we define <em>slow</em> and how do we define <em>suck</em>? We are perception brokers. But perceptions are fluid and, well, perceptual. How can we measure something so dynamic?

Our traditional web performance metrics like start render, page load, speed index do not help us to measure perception!

The best UX metric needs to correlate to what users actually see, it needs to be easy to use and work out-of-the box in browsers, it should recognise that not all pixels and page elements are equal and should be customisable based on our knowledge of our sites.

<b>First meaningful paint (FMP)</b> - times the paint after which the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened or when web fonts are loaded, whichever comes later. Available in Chrome.

<b>Time to first interactive (TTFI)</b> - when the page is first expected to be usable and will respond quickly to user interactions. Available in WebPageTest and mPulse.

<b>Hero rendering times</b> - the time at which the largest image, largest background image and top-level heading render.

To help work out the best metrics, SpeedCurve created a [test page](http://lab.speedcurve.com/rendering/picker.php) where you can see what metric correlates best with your perception of page load. The results unsurprisingly show that there is no metric that works for all sites, nor one that works for all people.

<b>Custom metrics</b> are the only way to measure what you know is important to your page, for your users. E.g. time-to-first-scroll, time to product image. Unfortunately these aren't necessary accessible or easy to use.

Whatever you measure:
1. Know your most meaningful metrics
2. Track them with synthetic and RUM
3. Don't focus on averages and medians
4. Set goals / budgets
5. Make yourself accountable with alerts and reports
6. Mind regressions

## Jeremy Keith - What is a progressive web app?

There is a lot of confusion and misinformation about what progressive web apps (PWAs) are. They do not require a single-page application JavaScript framework!

Most of what makes a PWA is just what makes a got website - secure, fast and responsive. You can measure that a site has https, service worker and a web app manifest - that's what makes a <em>measurable</em> PWA.

> Add to home screen is a bit of a distraction for PWAs, don't worry too much about it

Service Workers are the key part of a PWA, and they enable varying levels of offline functionality:
1. An "offline" error page - e.g.
2. A full offline experience - e.g.
3. A user-initiated page download - e.g. [Una Kravet's](https://una.im) website

> Should your site be progressive web app? Yes, it should

Jeremy has [published a book](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline) about using Service Workers to create great offline experiences.

## Mark Leach and Andy Davies - Fast Fashion

Mark works at Missguided.com - a fast fashion brand aimed at trend-conscious women aged 18 - 29.

> Our job is to empower young women to feel strong and confident

Mark's customers are all on social media, and are keen to complain when the website is slow.

When working with NCC Group Web Performance (now Eggplant) Mark was told that there could be an additional Â£1.2M through performance improvements.

When analysing the website, it was discovered that the median Android page load time was <b>over 14 (fourteen) seconds</b>.

Adding <pre><link rel="preload"></pre> for web fonts and fixing some issues with Optimizely brought the Android page load time down by two seconds.

Removing BazaarVoice improved load time by a further <b>3 (three) seconds</b> for Android devices. This improvement led to an increase in weekly revenue of <b>56%</b> ðŸ˜®. When baselined against all other traffic with BazaarVoice still enabled, the net gain in revenue was <b>26%</b>.

When presenting to the board, initially they were pessimistic about the potential, but then saw the real data. Then they wanted more!

In October 2017, Missguided set a goal of a three second load time. Andy used [source map explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer) to visualise the JavaScript and CSS bundles. The JavaScript bundle was reduced by 42%!

Missguided then hired someone to manage A/B testing and experiments to improve speed, as Optimizely could not be removed. This involved removing the bundled jQuery from the Optimizely bundle, removing old experiments and those for non-production environments.

Overall, median performance on Android was improved from 14 seconds to just over 5 seconds.

## Lauren Younger - Managing Performance like a Product

Performance and product management have a lot in common, they are both about improving conversion and revenue, retaining users, manage the user experience and understanding people.

Four basic principles for performance management:

1. Understand
Market, competition, stakeholders, business KPIs.
<b>Qualitative</b> and quantitative data - using e.g. surveys and satisfaction scores. What does a 49% bounce rate mean? Were 49% of customers unsatisfied?

2. Define
Create a specific business case with SMART goals then get stakeholder buy-in.
Think beyond standard performance metrics (bounce rate, load time, session length), what about operations resource cost, global reach.

3. Prioritise
Prioritisation is hard, we're not very good at it and we tend to rely on opinion. Use data to create scores and ranking. It's easy to focus on the slowest pages, but you should use business information such as conversion impact to determine priority.

4. Communicate
We can't use the same communication methods when working with all of the stakeholders of your website. Marketing, operations and engineering all have different requirements and communication styles.

Measure the results. What went well? What could have been improved in the process?

<b>Share your success</b> and <b>thank the team</b>!

## Dan Shappir - Improving Performance for 100 Million Websites

Wix made performance a top priority feature in 2017. Performance has to be a feature in order to get resources, buy-in and a specification.

Wix runs >1,000 concurrent experiments and pushes to production around 200 times per day.

In order to protect performance, performance is measured during development, in pre-release and in production.

The biggest benefits seen by Wix (measured by change in first contentful paint):

<b>Server-Side Rendering</b> - 70% improvement for mobile devices and 40% improvement for desktop. However the time between render and interactive became longer due to the additional delay in downloading the JavaScript bundle.

<b>Caching</b> - before going crazy with service workers, ensure that your assets are actually cacheable at the client! 

<b>Smart Bundling</b> - depending on 

<b>HTTP/2</b> - 10 - 20% speed improvement by switching to HTTP/2.

<b>Resource Hints</b> - Using preconnect, preload and prefetch gave Wix a 10% speed improvement.

<b>Progressive Rendering</b> - by only rendering above-the-fold content in the first pass, Wix saw a 5 - 10% improvement.

<b>JavaScript Optimisation</b> - Wix saw a 10% improvement by profiling and optimising their common JavaScript bundle.

Wix are in the process of transitioning from a JavaScript-driven layout to CSS Grid! 

## Robin Marx - QUIC in theory and practice

Robin introduces the three main problems with HTTP/1.1:

1. 4xRTT (round-trip-time) connection setup
2. TCP head-of-line blocking
3. HTTP head-of-line blocking

We can fix a few of these issues with TLS 1.3, fast-start and resumption. Leading to a single RTT connection establishment.

HTTP/2 removes the TCP head-of-line blocking, but requires a single connection which is susceptible to packet loss. Robin's research has shown that HTTP/2 is up to five times slower than HTTP/1.1 in high packet-loss environments.

We can't just upgrade TCP - it is too pervasive and there are too many pieces of technology which are too slow to upgrade (e.g. proxies). The solution to this is to use a different transport-layer protocol: UDP.

QUIC is built on top of UDP with custom packet-loss recovery logic. Solving TCP head-of-line blocking. Beyond that, it encompasses all of our network learning over the past three decades. By design, QUIC mitigates against all known DDoS attacks, prevents middlebox meddling through full transport-layer encryption. It also uses unique connection IDs to prevent connections closing down when IP addresses change, and allows communication over multiple networks (e.g. 4G and WiFi).

QUIC further improves on HTTP / TCP with custom congestion control.

Google have launched their own version of this protocol: <em>gQUIC</em>. A standardised version, <em>iQUIC</em> is expected to land at the end of 2018.

Google Search speed improvements: 8% on desktop, 3.6% on mobile. 16% improvement in 99th percentile.

20% less rebuffering on YouTube India, 14% faster on 4G, 20% slower than HTTP/1.1 with packet loss (HTTP/2 is 200% slower).

But, some research shows 75% lower throughput and QUIC costs 2x the CPU time on servers.

For QUIC connections on mobile devices, 58% of the time the network is faster than the CPU!
