Velocity Amsterdam has just come to a close. Here are the five key things that I am taking away from the two days of sessions.

## 2. Team success == business success

## 3. Performance goals, targets and KPIs are broken

## 4. We still struggle with data visualisation

## 5. We are under-utilising or abusing great Web features
HTTP/2 Push. Preload. PWAs.

## BONUS. Corporate IT sucks
