Velocity Amsterdam has just come to a close. Here are the five key things that I am taking away from the two days of sessions.

## 1. Performance targets and KPIs are broken

This was one of the themes that ran like an undercurrent through the whole conference, starting with [Steve Souders]() at [WebPerfDays] on the Sunday before Velocity.
talking about the death of window.onload for performance measurement.

## 2. Team success == business success
This was a positive theme that ran through a lot of the talks at velocity. We must enable our teams to do their jobs, let them make their own decisions and remove micro-management.
A great example of this was given by []() from SkyBet, talking about [Surviving the Grand National](). In the run up to the biggest event in SkyBet's calendar, they knew it was going to be tough. XXX even said "we knew we were going to run out of compute, we just didn't know where". In order to survive an event where just minutes of downtime can cost Â£100,000s of bets, SkyBet has cross-team 'squads'.

## 3. We are under-utilising or abusing great Web features
HTTP/2 Push. Preload. PWAs

## 4. We still struggle with data visualisation

## 5. We need a performance conference

## BONUS. Corporate IT sucks

## BONUS BONUS. Empathise with your audience
